    Hi! My name is Molly Baron and I’m in my third year studying advertising in the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications with a minor in information management and technology. I am interested in working for an advertising agency in the future. Currently I’m the fashion editor for Equal Time Magazine and am apart of the sorority Sigma Delta Tau. I am from West Hartford, Connecticut. I love traveling, my two dogs, going to dinner with friends, playing tennis, and shopping. My all time favorite television show is One Tree Hill. When I was in high school I traveled to Paraguay twice with my school on a community service trip!
