    <h1> Molly's Biography</h1>
    <h2> Personal info</h2>
   <p> 
       Hi! My name is Molly Baron and I’m in my third year studying advertising in the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications with a minor in information management and technology. I am interested in working for an advertising agency in the future. Currently I’m the <strong> fashion editor </strong> for Equal Time Magazine and am apart of the sorority Sigma Delta Tau. I am from West Hartford, Connecticut. 
     </p> 

        I love:

            <li>My two dogs</li>
            <li> Dinner with my friends</li>
            <li> Playing tennis </li>
            <li> Shopping </li>
        </ul>

        My all time favorite television show is One Tree Hill. When I was in high school I traveled to Paraguay twice with my school on a community service trip!
