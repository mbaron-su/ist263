    <h1> Eye Spy With My Little Eye Tea Bags And Croissants </h1>
    <p> 
        In the summer of 2013, my grandparents surprised my family with a trip to Europe. Although it rained a lot, London was such a quaint place. I drank tea every day and learned how to properly wave like the Queen. Below is a summarized itinerary of my trip: </p> <br>

<h2> Day One: Buckingham Palace </h2> 
    <p> We started off the trip at the center of London- the Queen’s home. We watched the changing of the guards and of course, took lots of pictures. It was very surreal. Through the gate bars we saw a glimpse of the Queen. I remember how small and elegant she looked. We had to politely barge our way through the tourist filled crowd to sneak a peek.</p> 


<h2> Day Two: Tea Party</h2>
<p> We continued our travels with a cute little afternoon tea party at Claridge’s. This was a beautiful, elegant, and glamorous hotel that offers tea parties at their restaurant. We were served little sandwich towers and a wide range of teas. My favorite part was the dessert. Marble cake, lemon cake, and so much more. I really did feel like a princess. </p> 


<h2> Day Three: The London Eye</h2>
<p> How can you go to London and not take a trip in the London Eye? The London Eye is an observation wheel on the South Bank of the River Thames in London. Although I am scared of heights I conquered my fear and don’t regret it one bit. The views from 450 feet up were amazing. The London Bridge and Big Ben looked small from up above.</p> 


<h2> Day Four: The Tower of London</h2> 
<p> This historic landmark, known officially as Her Majesty’s Royal Palace and Fortress, holds royal possessions. Filled with jewelry and other valuable objects. It’s a very fascinating place with a lot of history. </p> 

<h2>  Day Five: The British Museum </h2>
<p> The last day concluded with a visit to the city’s largest museum. There we saw work from collections of Egypt, Greek, and Roman antiquities. Additionally, we saw the Rosetta Stone, sculptures from the Parthenon, and even mummies.</p>    

<p> All in all, London was a fabulous city that I would love to eventually go back to one day. The four days quickly came to a close and my family and I took the Eurostar via the “Chunnel” to the city of love. </p>

<h1> Bonjour! </h1>
<p> My four day trip to Paris was extraordinary. I’ll never forget the beautiful sites, amazing food, and unforgettable memories. Below is a summarized itinerary of my four day journey:</p> 
<br> 
<h2> Day One: Château de Versailles </h2>
<p>We began our journey through Paris at the famous Château de Versailles. Beautiful is an understatement. That palace glitters in all its gold. The gardens are perfected and the room of mirrors was magical. This was truly one of the most beautiful places I’ve ever been to.</p>


<h2> Day Two: The Louvre </h2>
<p> The Musée du Louvre is spectacular. The masterpieces are truly breathtaking. I couldn't believe how small the Mona Lisa was. She was protected by a glass case and stared at by the whole museum. It really felt like she was staring into my soul. All the art in that museum was incredible. </p>


<h2> Day Three: Eiffel Tower </h2>
<p> Three floors, 1,665 steps, and an unreal view of the city of Paris. The Eiffel Tower is spotted wherever you go in Paris. It stands tall and proud and is a powerful symbol of the city. I could not stop taking pictures while all the way at the top. My dad and I walked down all the steps to the bottom. If you are ever in Paris you need to make sure to get to the Eiffel Tower! In the future, I would love to eat at the restaurant all the way at the top. </p> 


<h2> Day Four: Seine Boat Tour  </h2>
<p> Our final day in Europe concluded with a boat tour down the Seine River. It was relaxing and beautiful. I remember the weather was perfect. We saw the Eiffel Tower from a distance as well as the other amazing sights of Paris. It really was a perfect ending to one of the best trips. </p>

<p> I’m forever grateful my grandparents took my family and I on this unforgettable trip. I cannot wait to travel back to London and Paris in the future! If you ever get the chance I highly recommend both of these cities. Bon voyage!<br>
