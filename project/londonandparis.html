        In the summer of 2013, my grandparents surprised my family with a trip to Europe. Although it rained a lot, London was such a quaint place. I drank tea every day and learned how to properly wave like the queen. Below is a summarized itinerary of my trip: </p> <br>

<p> Day One: Buckingham Palace <br>
We started off the trip at the center of London- the Queen’s home. We watched the changing of the guards and of course, took lots of pictures. It was very surreal. Through the gate bars we saw a glimpse of the Queen. I remember how small and elegant she looked. We had to politely barge our way through the tourist filled crowd to sneak a peek.</p>

<p> Day Two: Tea Party <br>
We continued our travels with a cute little afternoon tea party at Claridge’s. This was a beautiful, elegant, and glamorous hotel that offers tea parties at their restaurant. We were served little sandwich towers and a wide range of teas. My favorite part was the dessert. Marble cake, lemon cake, and so much more. I really did feel like a princess. </p>

<p> Day Three: The London Eye <br>
How can you go to London and not take a trip in the London Eye? The London Eye is an observation wheel on the South Bank of the River Thames in London. Although I am scared of heights I conquered my fear and don’t regret it one bit. The views from 450 feet up were amazing. The London Bridge and Big Ben looked small from up above.</p>

<p> Day Four: The Tower of London <br>
This historic landmark, known officially as Her Majesty’s Royal Palace and Fortress, holds royal possessions. Filled with jewelry and other valuable objects. It’s a very fascinating place with a lot of history. </p> 

<p> Day Five: The British Museum <br>
The last day concluded with a visit to the city’s largest museum. There we saw work from collections of Egypt, Greek, and Roman antiquities. Additionally, we saw the Rosetta Stone, sculptures from the Parthenon, and even mummies.</p>    

<p> All in all, London was a fabulous city that I would love to eventually go back to one day. The four days quickly came to a close and my family and I took the Eurostar via the “Chunnel” to the city of love. </p>
