            <li> July 2013: destination- Paris, France: From London my family and I took the Eurostar train to Paris. Our four day trip consisted of seeing the infamous Mona Lisa, going to the classic touristy places, and a whole lot of chocolate croissants.</li> <br>
            <li> March 2018 and 2019: destination- Tobati, Paraguay: My high school classmates and I took a fourteen day volunteer community service trip to one of the most special places I’ve ever been to. We worked closely with the Macchi	School to improve the lives of disadvantaged youth. </li> <br>
            <li> June 2017:  destination- Havana, Cuba: The people of Havana welcomed us with open arms, smiles, and a lot of music. We traveled to tobacco fields, saw historical sites and even drove around in vintage cars!   </li> <br>
